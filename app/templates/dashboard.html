            As you spend less and earn more, you'll begin to earn a profit and
            save more money. Maybe at first you'll have a few dollars per month
            in surplus. Eventually, however, you'll find that you're saving 10%,
            20%, or even 50% of your everything you earn. The average person
            spends his surplus on whatever wants come to mind. Instead of using
            the money to get ahead, he stays in the same place. Or, worse, he
            falls behind by taking on debt. A smart money manager puts her
            profit to use by investing for the future. At first, you'll pursue
            short-term goals. If you're in debt, get out of debt. Destroying
            high-interest debt offers the best possible return for your money.
            Build a cash reserve. It's smart to have money in a savings account
            to cover short-term emergencies. Invest in yourself. Remember: the
            more you learn, the more you earn. Increase your skills and
            education. Update your wardrobe and improve your health. Become a
            better you. Pursue your personal mission: fund college funds for the
            kids, pay off the mortgage, start a business, spend a year in
            southeast Asia. Use money as a tool to improve your life. After your
            near-term wants and needs are satisfied, it's time to look farther
            into the future, toward retirement and Financial Independence. You
            know what that means, right? It's time to invest in the stock
            market! Investing doesnâ€™t have to be difficult. If you keep things
            simple, you can invest yourself and receive reasonable returns â€” all
            with a minimum of work and worry.
